**OWS Context 1.0 Conformance Test Suite**

This test suite checks context documents for conformance to the "OGC OWS Context 
Conceptual Model" specification, version 1.0 (OGC 12-080r2). A _context document_
specifies a fully configured service set which can be exchanged among clients 
supporting the standard; it was created to allow a set of configured information 
resources to be passed between applications primarily as a collection of services.
